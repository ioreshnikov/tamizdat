_Tamizdat refers to literature published abroad (там, tam, "there"),
often from smuggled manuscripts._

Tamizdat is a telegram bot that allows you to search `flibusta.net`
library and to deliver the books you want from there to an email
address of your choice. The main use-case for that is to send the
books from the library to your Kindle device via an Amazon email
address.
